# ðŸ§  Knowledge Base Feature Implementation

_As you complete tasks and reference relevant files, update this file as our memory to help with future tasks._

This file is structured to track the development of the knowledge base system and integrations with large language models. Please keep this file updated as Cursor progresses through the implementation flow. âœ…

---

## âœ… Completed Tasks

- [x] TipTap implementation for rich text editing
- [x] Created basic Knowledge database model
- [x] Implemented CRUD operations for knowledge entries
- [x] Built UI components for knowledge management
- [x] Implemented knowledge extraction for email drafting
- [x] Integrated knowledge-based drafting in reply generation flow

---

## ðŸ”„ In Progress Tasks

### ðŸ§© Phase 1: Smart Drafting with Knowledge Base
- [ ] Attach knowledge base context when drafting replies
- [ ] Set up fallback mechanism if knowledge entries are missing
- [ ] Add logging for reply generation using knowledge entries

### ðŸ§  Phase 2: Dual LLM Architecture
- [ ] Integrate a cheaper LLM (e.g., Gemini Flash) for knowledge extraction
- [x] Extract relevant data from knowledge base with extraction LLM
- [ ] Configure environment variables to switch between LLMs based on task
- [ ] Keep existing core model (e.g., GPT-4) for final response generation
- [ ] Benchmark latency and cost of dual model flow

### ðŸ’¬ Phase 3: Contextual Memory Enhancements
- [ ] Extract relevant data from previous conversations
- [ ] Link prior threads to current conversation context
- [ ] Store long-term memory entries in the knowledge base
- [ ] Add confidence score for each extracted memory chunk

---

## ðŸ§ª Ideas for Future Tasks

- [ ] Add semantic search over knowledge base
- [ ] Auto-summarize newly added knowledge entries
- [ ] Build an admin panel to review/edit extracted knowledge
- [ ] Implement user-level memory scoping
- [ ] Visualize knowledge connections (graph-based UI)

## ðŸ§  Cursor Rules

> When interacting with this file:
>
> 1. **Always update completed tasks** with `[x]` when done.
> 2. **Prompt user approval** before starting the next phase.
> 3. **Log any relevant files changed** next to the task (in a comment or sub-bullet).
> 4. **Do not auto-complete future tasks** until explicitly requested.
> 5. Tasks are grouped by development phase. Follow the order.
